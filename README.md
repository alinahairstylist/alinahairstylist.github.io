# Alina Hairstylist Website

## Basic Site Info
Run locally with `npm start` <br>
Publish to gh-pages with `npm run deploy` <br>

## Adding Images
Navigate to the services folder by going to `src > assets > services`, 
or click [here](https://github.com/alinahairstylist/alinahairstylist.github.io/tree/main/src/assets/services). <br>
In the top right, click `Add file` and under the dropdown click `Upload files`. <br><br>

The image MUST be a jpeg or it will NOT show up! The image must be named '#.jpeg' where # is some number, or it will NOT show up! <br>
Do not upload an image with the same name as an existing image in the folder. Images will display in the order that
they are named. <br> (i.e. 1.jpeg first, 2.jpeg second, etc.) <br>
The number of total images in the folder is not particularly important (although any more than 18 will not show up), 
but multiples of 4 look best on desktop, and multiples of 2 look best on mobile. Between 8 and 12 look best, otherwise the
shapes on the sides of the page get too spread out (not a huge deal but something to keep in mind).
